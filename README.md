Using countries' rankings by different categories for predictive analytic.

by Noel Carrascal

Overview

The CIA world fact-book is a source of data about countries.
It is created to keep basic information about all countries
of the world in a almanac form. The information is reliable and
can be use as input to do predictive analytic. For example,
It keep records of yearly GDP and commodity values for all countries
that could be used to predict future currency values. 
In this report, only the year 2014 is considered. Other years
will be added at a later stage. The csv files in this directory
correspond to database tables in the CIA fact-book. They are:
categories,  countries,  fields,  ranks,  regions and values.
These are Of particular relevance to my project. There are
two hundred and sixty one countries grouped in 13 categories.
There are seventy six fields grouped in nine categories.
The countries are rank by fields. I want to work on how to
turn this CIA world factbook into a data science tool for
people to access it when trying to find answers to other problems.
I will try to test this fact-book to predict fluctuations
in the ranking of countries. Because I am only using 2014 rankings,
I want to predict changes in rankings for 2015.
