Using the CIA factbook country rankings for predictive and descriptive analytics.

by Noel Carrascal

Overview

The CIA world fact-book is a description US government profiles of countries and territories around the world. 
Information on geography, people, government, transportation, economy, communications, etc. The information is 
reliable and can be use as input to do predictive analytics. The factbook contains information for two hundred 
and sixty one countries grouped in 9 categories: Introduction, Geography, People and Society, Government, Economy, 
Energy, Communications, Transportation and Military. Countries are also divided into 13 regions: Oceans, Africa, 
Antarctica, Australia-Oceania, Central America and Caribbean, Central Asia, East & Southeast Asia, Europe, 
Middle East, North America, South America, South Asia and Ocean. Countries are ranked by 76 fields such as
Surface Area, population, GDP, birth rate, etc. 

For this project I will start with the 2014 factbook to predict GDP (gross domestic product purchasing power). 
The 2014 factbook has GDP information for the previous three years. I will use those numbers to predict GDP for 
2014 for every country. This is because the 2014 factbook was published in the middle of the year and do not 
include values for that same year.

I will use regression analysis and other algorithms to predict GDP and rankings. I will use correlation
analysis to relate rankings from different fields and reveal which ones are more closely related to GDP.
These field correlations could then be used to improve predictions obtained from regression analysis alone. 
I believe I can finish this by the end of the class. The following analysis will be done if time permits. 

-Comparison of clustering methods using country rankings of some the 76 fields. 
-The 76 fields can be considered as multiple dimensions of each country. I want to apply principal component 
analysis to do a multivariate analysis.
-I want to try to answer the question of how much information in the CIA factbook can be used as input for the 
prediction of currency fluctuations. I could try to relate CIA factbook data with currency exchange data from 
the Federal reserve. The hypothesis is that information on some of the rankings could be an indicator of long-term 
currency fluctuations. This could be couple with methods that predict short term currency fluctuations to make
a more robust algorithm. 

Data source 
I have curare ted the 2014 factbook into cvs files that are found in this repository. I removed a lot of information 
to focus on parts of the fact-book that can be quantified and ranked.

Code
I have written a python program that loads and cleans the information in the csv files. For now, it just places the
ranking data in a 261 x 76 numpy array. This array will be the primary data structure to do the analysis described 
above.
